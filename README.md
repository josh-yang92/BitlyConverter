# BitlyProject

A simple python app to convert combined link (an affiliate link and a product link in www.notino.com) to a shorter link using the bitly API.

User must be registered with bitly and have their user name and the API key in order to use this app. These attributes must be saved in a keys.txt file outside of the parent directory.

e.g. if the app is in **~/converter/app** then the keys.txt file must be in **~/converter**.
